**StackLegacy** is a reference to a cutting edge technology stacks.

In the past few years, Technology changed very rapidly. Choosing the right technology in solving a problem is very important. A wrong choice of technology, could turn your system into a Legacy Mode. Where the bug patches turns into an unmaintainable and confusion of your system.

Each of the system’s architecture in StackLegacy was written by either the engineer of the system or our Administrator.

As an Engineer in Computing, we need to ensure that we don’t use a dying technology as a solution for system, unless no other choices. But bear in mind, that old technology is not a dying technology. Some older technology survive that it is so powerful that none can replace it.

## Background
**In 2012,** I had an issue when choosing technology to be implemented on a piece of problem. Technology options have been changing rapidly  in the recent years. We are bombarded with cool Technologies. So I’m confused of what should I use best to build a system like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

So as a perfectionist engineer, I always want to use the latest updated technology and best in its advantage of solving my problem. With that said, I always do a Google search with a keyword like “How to build a website like facebook”. From the search result, we found what we are looking for. But we always missed large portion of the information. Something like how the server managed a high load of request. Then again we tried another search “How facebook scales”. This is just one portion that we missed. There are many more portion to build a system like Facebook.

## Summary
So StackLegacy will be planned to be a reference of the systems stacks and architecture. Allowing Engineer to share what they’ve build or they know. And help other junior engineer to learn from the advise of the senior engineer on what is good or bad about particular technology.
